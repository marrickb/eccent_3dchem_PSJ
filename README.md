Python code to reproduce the figures from Braam et al. (2025): , see https://doi.org/10.3847/PSJ/ad9565. 
Repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that were used to produce the Figures 1-11 in the manuscript, and Figures 12-19 in the Appendices. Due to the large size of the output from the 3D coupled climate-chemistry models, the data will be shared by reasonable request to the corresponding author (Marrick Braam, marrick.braam@unibe.ch). The emission spectra were produced using NASA's Planetary Spectrum Generator and its GlobES tool (https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov/apps/globes.php), and are provided in the folder _emission_spectra_psg_.
