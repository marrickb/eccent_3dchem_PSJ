This folder contains emission spectra generated using NASA's Planetary Spectrum Generator and in particular the GlobES tool (https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov/apps/globes.php). The conversion from 3D CCM output from the Unified Model and UK Chemistry and Aerosols framework is described in the notebooks for Figure 11. Special thanks to Geronimo Villanueva, Thomas Fauchez, and the PSG team for making PSG and GlobES open-source.
